# For catkin it is simpler to do add site-packages to PYTHONPATH in _setup_util.py.in than us doing it from here...
# but until catkin does this by default, the proper way from outside catkin is probably a env-hook like this one

# Note : We should enable site-package only on devel space.
# Install space should behave like packages, everything in debian layout.

# TODO : find a cleaner way to call a shell function defined in another script

# Setting up the catkin environment itself
# This needs to be in a different prefix, to be able to generate an install dir with setuptools, yet clear of any catkin_pip artifacts.
# Also this path needs to ALWAYS be added to PYTHONPATH. Mandatory the first time we run catkin_pip to setup the environment.
